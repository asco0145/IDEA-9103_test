# Quiz 8 
This is my quiz 8 submission.

### **Part 1**
Glitch art is an unconventional style that transforms traditional imagery into something unpredictable and striking. It can be achieved through databending, circuit bending, or direct data manipulation. I find this inspiring because the outcomes are endless—no two pieces are alike, as results depend on how the program is coded. This unpredictability allows for abstract, playful, and dynamic works, especially if animations are added. Glitch art also fits the assignment challenge, since it emphasizes representing an artwork in a way that both copies and abstracts it through code.

### **Part 2**
A useful coding technique for glitch art is glitch lines, where image data is disrupted by shifting horizontal or vertical pixel strips. In p5.js or Processing, this effect can be created using loadPixels() and updatePixels(), or by redrawing line segments at random offsets. This technique is powerful because it allows precise control over how chaotic or subtle the glitch appears. It would help me recreate the fragmented, distorted look of glitch art while still referencing the original image, aligning well with the assignment’s goal of representing an artwork through code.
